* Ephemeral Inbox

=0-Inbox= is ephemeral.  If it exists, then sort its contents to empty, then delete it.

[[https://treefactor-docs.nfshost.com][Treefactor]] automatically creates a =0-Inbox= when it refiles objects.  Otherwise you must create it manually.

If you see a =0-Inbox=, refile its contents ASAP, to avoid losing track of potentially-important info.  Then delete it.

Remember that info in an Inbox may be misfiled.  It could belong in a completely different section of the tree.  Don't assume its contents.

Refiling creates more Inboxes, of course.  But they're deeper in the outline, where you won't see them unless you're working nearby.

If an Inbox is buried out of sight, chances are good it's irrelevant.

To avoid wrongly-buried Inboxes, be sure to promote a misfiled object as high as it should go before getting distracted.  Just walk back up the tree, refiling any Inbox you spot until you reach the top.
