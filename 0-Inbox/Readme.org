* Ephemeral Inbox

Treefactor automatically creates a =0-Inbox= when it refiles objects.

If you see a =0-Inbox=, refile its contents ASAP.  Otherwise you may lose track of important info inside it.

Refiling creates more Inboxes, of course.  But they're deeper in the outline, where you won't see them unless you're working on that area.  

If the Inboxes are buried out of sight, chances are good they don't have anything relevant to what you're doing now.

Remember that info in an Inbox may be misfiled.  It could belong in a completely different section of the tree.  Don't assume its contents.
