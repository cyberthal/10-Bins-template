~9-Background~ holds low-priority background info that doesn't fit into the other 10 Bins.  

Background info is knowledge that is not actionable but provides useful context.

~9-Background~ is like a reference library.  The Dewey Decimal Classification could work here, although I don't recommend it.  It's just helpful to realize that if Dewey Decimal went anywhere, it would be here.

Everything that doesn't fit in the other 10 Bins goes here.
