* Queuing for departure

=1-Outbox= is a directory for content that does not belong in this git repository.

It is permanent.  Don't delete it, even if it's empty.

Pubmind repos are the most likely destination for headings in the Textmind =1-Outbox=.

Divide =1-Outbox= into subdirectories by destination.  

Keep an eye on its contents as they accumulate.  Batch export them when needed.

If you're exporting one subdirectory, you may as well export them all.  Otherwise contents may accumulate indefinitely in a subdirectory whose destination doesn't generate conscious demand for export.

If you've totally forgotten what's in =1-Outbox=, and it's got lots of content, you'd better batch export before working on any of the destination repos.  Otherwise you might be forgetting something important.
