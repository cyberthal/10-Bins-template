What it's made of.  

Due to cascade matching, only substances that fail =2-Name= go here.

For example, "paper" is a solid name.  The nearest synonyms, such as "papyrus" or "sheet" or "cardboard", are distant.  It goes in =2-Name=.  

However, "rock" and "stone" are synonymous, and neither is dominant.  Both go in =3-Substance=.
