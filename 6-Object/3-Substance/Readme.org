What it's made of.  

Due to cascade matching, only substances that fail =2-Name= go here.

For example, "paper" has only one name for its category, even though there are different kinds of paper.  It goes in =2-Name=.  

However, "rock" and "stone" are synonymous, and neither is dominant.  Both would go here.
