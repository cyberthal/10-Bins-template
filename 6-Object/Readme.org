=6-Object= is a directory about objects. 

Cars and computers are objects.  Software is not an object.

You are a person but your body is an object, so file your physical health info here.  

Use cascade matching.  Water is both a substance and has a solid name, so it should go under =2-Name=.

I haven't tried to systematically file by chemical formula.  However, I suggest doing so under =6-Object/2-Name/#-Chemical-formula=, because the names are solid.  # means pick whatever number.  Using a subdirectory prevents the profusion of number-heavy chemical formulae from ruining the ergonomics of the rest of =2-Name=.
