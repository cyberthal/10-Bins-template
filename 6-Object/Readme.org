* Object oriented

6-Object is a directory for headings pertaining to objects. 

Your car and your computer are objects.  You are a person but your body is an object.  The Earth is a place, not an object.

Suggested subdirectories:
#+begin_src
1-persint
2-Name
3-Substance
4-Type
5-Func
6-Department
#+end_src

Name - flat list of objects with a single unique memorable name.

Substance - what it's made of.  For example, paper and water.

Type - what kind of thing it is.  E.g. containers, food, electronics.

Func - what it's for.  E.g. travel kit, cooking equipment.

Department - what department it would be sold under.  If something defies categorization by other means, someone still has to sell it.

Use cascade matching.  Vertically higher matches outrank lower ones.  Water is both a substance and has a single unique memorable name, so it should go under =2-Name=.
