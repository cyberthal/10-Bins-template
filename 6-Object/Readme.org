* Object oriented

=6-Object= is a directory for headings pertaining to objects. 

Your car and your computer are objects.  You are a person but your body is an object.  The Earth is a place, not an object.

Use cascade matching.  Vertically higher matches outrank lower ones.  Water is both a substance and has a single unique memorable name, so it should go under =2-Name=.

I haven't tried to systematically file by chemical formula.  However, I recommend doing so under =6-Object/2-Name/#-Chemical-formulae=, because the names are solid.  # here means pick whatever number.  Use a subdirectory to prevent the profusion of number-heavy chemical formula from ruining the ergonomics of the rest of =2-Name=.
