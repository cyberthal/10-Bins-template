`6-Object` holds info classifiable by object: the elements of the periodic table, your possessions, animals, etc.

Cars and computers are objects.  Software is not an object.

You are a person but your body is an object, so file your physical health info here.  

I haven't tried to systematically file by chemical formula.  However, I suggest doing so under `6-Object/2-Name/#-Chemical-formula`, because the names are solid.  # means pick whatever number.  Using a subdirectory prevents the profusion of number-heavy chemical formulae from ruining the ergonomics of the rest of `2-Name`.
