# Geography and beyond

`5-Location` is a directory for content about places.

Your house is a place.  So is the moon.

Your body isn't a place; it's an object.

The USA is a place.  Its government can be considered a subset of that place.  American people, however, are a group that includes expats and travelers.  Only information that is specific to Americans within the USA should go in `5-Location`.
