* Head-Up Display

This special directory occurs only once in a Textmind or Binmind.  

It's a special workspace where new info is forged, that hasn't been filed into 10 Bins yet.  

In Textmind, it's designed to facilitate rambling guided by a dashboard.

You could do something similar in Binmind.  The exact implementation would depend on what software you were using.  For example, you might start a new Adobe Illustrator project in your Hud, until you decided where to file it.
