What if 10 Bins is deployed in an agenda or task manager?

Complex ambiguous prose plans don't go here.  Only the actionables they generate go in the agenda.

This allows agenda tasks to be rankable against each other.  It should be easy to rerank them according to available resources, mood and fancy.

Agenda entries can be specific small tasks or open-ended project stubs, as long as they're rankable and actionable.

The wording of the entry needn't be actionable, as long as it contains actionables within it.

But if it doesn't contain actionables, then beware!  Carefully word the entry as a specific actionable.  Avoid vague mental flailing.  It generates needless stress, wastes time and dilutes intelligence.
