* Head-Up Display

Hud is the directory where the majority of your activity occurs.  It shows what you are doing right now.

It is like the Heads-Up Display (HUD) of an airplane cockpit.  It's what you look at while you're switching tasks and doing light to medium work.

It contains three files:
- ='1sprinting.org=
- ='2sprinted.org=
- ='3dashboard.org=
