* Hyperlinked prose

=2-Linked= is a directory for your linked prose.  It is within Org's secondary search scope.  Directories are searched recursively, so use as much tree depth as you need.

Org link search finds GUIDs (Globally Unique IDentifiers) in =1-Agenda= and =2-Linked=.  Org agenda search only finds headings in =1-Agenda=.

=2-Linked= searches can rely on cached results, whereas =1-Agenda= searches cannot.  Therefore the former can store much more text than the latter, without causing excessive lag.

To read more about GUID link searches, see Textmind/by-Part/Org-mode/org-id.
