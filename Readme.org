* 10 Bins organizes your life

** Intro

Treefactor is a software tool that allows rapidly filing objects in a directory tree.  

However, having a fast tool doesn't help much if you can't decide where things should go!

That sounds like a joke, but it's not.  Deciding where to file your personal information is surprisingly difficult.  Keeping it synced to reflect changes in the world and yourself is even harder.

10 Bins solves this problem, making filing easy, automatic and reliable.

10 Bins is a directory structure and set of filing rules.  It's called "10 Bins" because there are 10 standard directories, numbered 0 through 9 for quick access.

** Reading order

Each directory contains a =Readme.org= explaining its purpose.  The documentation avoids repetition.

Before reading more than one level deep in the tree, first read =7-Names/Readme.org=.  "Solid names" is a conceptual prerequisite.

** Cascade matching

Always sort in alphabetical order.

Lower-number matches outrank higher-number matches.

In other words, earlier matches beat later ones.

For example, "Germany" is both a location and a name.  =5-Location= is earlier than =7-Names=, so "Germany" belongs in the former.
