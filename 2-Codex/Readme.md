`2-Codex` is a directory for content that is primarily intended for consumption by computers, not humans. 

`2-Codex` is focused on the machine-readable aspect of a file, such as its metadata fields, version history and path.

Prose doesn't belong.  Keep it to a minimum.

Code snippets belong here, before they migrate to their own repos.

Any file not written for human eyes belongs here.

Paths belong here.  Domain names don't, but IP addresses do.

Information about files stored outside Textmind belongs here.  The goal is to be a sparse index of files stored outside Textmind, for easy reference.  If you have copious prose notes about a file, link to the file's `2-Codex` entry (or merely allude to it) but store the prose in e.g.  `9-Background`.  

For example, say you took notes on the movie Titanic.  Your notes about the movie would belong under `7-Names`.  The path of the video file, and notes about torrenting it, go under `2-Codex`.
