* It's all part of the plan

=8-Action= is a directory for actionable headings.

"People should be nicer to each other" is not actionable (by you).  "Be nicer to people" is actionable by you.

A dissertation on why people should be nice to each other goes in =9-Background= (or perhaps =3-Names= if you'd rather file it by author.)

Your 12-step plan to start treating people better goes under =8-Action=.
