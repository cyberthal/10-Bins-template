* by Name

=7-Names= is a directory for content that should be filed by name.

You know many names: of people, websites, brands, organizations, communities, etc.

The purpose of the bidirectiona vs unidirectional division is to highlight warm prospective contacts, and contacts more relevant to you.

Most of your relationships will be unidirectional, unless you're both famous and influential, so the few whom you've interacted with are more important.
