# Solid names

`2-flat` is for unambiguous names you both recognize and recall.  If you don't recall the name on demand, then it's effectively lost in the list!

The target should have only one primary name.  Otherwise multiple directories can exist for the same target, dividing your files on the target, without you noticing!

`2-flat` contains a flat list of names.  Each name is already a primary category in your mind.  So why bury them deeper in the tree?

Names that qualify for this directory are called "solid names".  Solid names are a very useful filing shortcut which 10 Bins uses wherever possible.  Whenever you see a directory like `2-Name`, assume it's for solid names.
